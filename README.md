This is a project that I made for a math class.

If there are two objects that have the same mass and there are no other gravitational forces are acting on the obects, when the object reach a steady state what will there trajectory be?

The answer is they will move in a figure 8 patern chasing each other. 

This code maps thier trajectory.
